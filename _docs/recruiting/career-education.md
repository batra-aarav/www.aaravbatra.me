# Academic Preparation

## Advertising
* Sports and Entertainment Marketing
* Marketing Capstone Honors

These marketing classes helped me progress my skills with introducting new ideas to people around our school. I was able to use the information gained to create promotional videos of the winter/spring weightlifting program and was able to sign up 35-40 new lifters in the gym. I also used this to promote football themed activities for Autism and Cancer awareness. College coaches and professional team recruiters want to see players involved in their community, in which having massive turnouts increases my chances of being a more preferred recruit.

By promoting our team online, I was able to help my coach network with other high school football coaches at schools such as Edison, and Phillipsburg. I was also able to help my coach get connected with the special teams coordinator at Fairleigh-Dickinson University, in which a player from our team signed the same year.

## Activity Planning
* Developing Student Leaders Honors

This class has helped me prepare to organize team activities year-round and helped me recruit prospective football players to the team. I used my planning skills to create activities in school sponsored events and was able to sign up 20-30 underclassmen players for the season. My future career is postively impacted with soft skills and connections for further successful events, growing my network with college coaches and professional team recruiters.

I also used this experience to start the process of creating an FBLA Middle School chapter, by networking with the school administration and scheduling meetings to create a budget proposal to the Board of Education. This experience helped me tremendously with my interpersonal skills on video and over-the-phone meetings. I struggled a lot with this, especially after COVID-19, dealing with social isolation and the lack of social development.

## ReadRPO

* AP C.S. A
* AP C.S. Principles
* Intro. to C.S.
* Physics Accelerated
* Geometry with Trignometry
* Animation

These classes prepared me to create a computer vision model which reviews live football film, uses advanced geometry and triangulation formulas to pinpoint the location of players on the field, breaking down plays in real-time. Obtaining a research grant from Roboflow,the number one computer vision model company, allowed for live testing for regular season football games. The research paper and its findings were posted on their website, with animated renderings of the broken down plays (below). This fundamental understanding of the gamea allowed me to increase my "Football IQ" (IQ in terms of football understanding), which is a highly desirable trait amongst top athletic recruits in the nation. I used this newfound skill to be recruited by 5 top D1 FBS universities, including Rutgers, Princeton, University of Memphis, University of Maryland, and Pittsburgh.

The classes and project allowed me to network towards obtaining a role as an Advanced Research Intern at NJCCIC and subsequently with JerseyCTF and NJIT. I led an advanced research team which explored advanced attacks on key fobs which included mimicing the frequency and unlocking vehicles undetected. I used this experience to further my ReadRPO project, and obtain another internship through NJCCIC with JerseyCTF and NJIT. I am currently working in this internship, allowing me to network with like-minded individuals and encourage contributions to my continuing independent research.
