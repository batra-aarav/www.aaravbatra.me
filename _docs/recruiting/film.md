# Film - Athletic Recruiting

I'm ready to take my game to the next level! Click to watch my film playlist below:

My film consists of practice film such as throwing and long snapping repetitions. 
I also work on drills such as the 100 yd. Dash, 40 yd. Dash, L-Drill, Broad Jump, Vertical Jump, 5-10-5 (shuttle), accuracy cone knock down drills, and 3 variations of the agility ladder. 
I work hard in the gym on bench press, squat, deadlift, and other accessory hypertrophy/coordination/flexibility exercises.
