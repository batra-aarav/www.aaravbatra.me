## Football

I initially joined the Varsity Football Program as a #56 Guard/Defensive Tackle in my sophomore year. The best use of my potential was as a Quarterback and Long Snapper, so I worked hard to try to earn both positions in my junior year. However, I was only successful at LS. Working hard in the offseason, I continued into my senior year to earn the quarterback position and successfully earned the position as #12 Quarterback/LS. I continue to work hard toward a walk-on opportunity at the collegiate level.

## Future Business Leaders of America

As a part of FBLA, I participated in the NJ State Leadership Conference hosted at Harrah's in Atlantic City. 
Inspired to create change in my chapter, I spearheaded the creation of a middle school chapter across Hammarskjold Upper Elementary School (HUES) and Churchill Junior High School (CJHS), working closely with administration and the East Brunswick Board of Education (EBBOE). 
I also worked as a photographer for the chapter, capturing group events, and managing the online presence for the club. 
As a chapter member, I participated in Regional Competitive Events and Straight to State Events.

## Family, Career, and Community Leaders of America

As a member of FCCLA, I had the opportunity to immerse myself in various leadership activities that focused on personal development, career exploration, and community service. 
I participated in hands-on projects and initiatives that promoted family well-being and civic engagement. 
Through FCCLA, I developed valuable leadership skills by taking part in events that helped me build a deeper connection to the community, while also collaborating with peers on impactful activities that made a difference in both our school and broader community.

## Code Club

As an active member of Code Club, I contributed to organizing events like "Hour of Code," aimed at introducing coding to younger students. 
The club encouraged collaboration through coding challenges and hands-on projects, helping participants grow their technical skills. 
Through my involvement, I gained a deeper understanding of computer science and helped foster a creative environment where students could explore technology, work together on projects, and share their knowledge of programming.

## Palette Club

In my role as the Club Ambassador for Palette Club, I had the privilege of helping to organize and promote art-related activities throughout the school. 
The club focuses on providing a creative space for students to explore various forms of artistic expression. 
One of the highlights of my time with Palette Club was collaborating with my Butterfly Kindness Initiative Project to host a Chalk-to-Walk event. 
This interactive event, which was featured in the school art magazine, encouraged students to use sidewalk chalk to create colorful, meaningful messages. 
Palette Club members worked alongside the Butterfly Kindness Initiative to bring the event to life, combining artistic creativity with a spirit of community engagement.
