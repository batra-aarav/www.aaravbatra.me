My name is Aarav Batra. I am the class of 2025 at East Brunswick High School. I have participated in many of my High School's programs such as Varsity Football, Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA), Code Club, and Palette Club. I have also received an award and grant from the East Brunswick Education Foundation for creating a positive learning environment at East Brunswick. I like to program in my free time and I have many projects you can feel free to check out. My main interests are at the intersection of computer science, business, and exercise science/kinesiology.

I am a player in the Varsity Football program which taught me the value of the hard work that you can put into a pursuit. In the program, I have also learned about leadership, the importance of a healthy body and mind, and the importance of academic and athletic balance. Ever since I joined the program my academics have linearly risen, and I also learned time management skills within the program. 

In FBLA, I was a contestant at the State Leadership Conference in Atlantic City, New Jersey. I participated in creating a Business Plan and wrote a comprehensive 17-page research paper detailing an athlete-focused gym business model with a 7-minute presentation component. During my time at the Conference, I also participated in many workshops and networked with the Executive Board and Chapter members. In those workshops, I learned the importance of thinking creatively under pressure and bringing people together to work towards a common goal. 

During my time in Code Club, I learned hard skills in programming languages and taught younger students in the Hour of Code program. In Hour of Code, I designed an easy-to-learn lesson plan that consisted of a text-based adventure game similar to the 1977 Zork series. It had a tree-based story in which your decisions permanently altered the outcome which branches out to a different ending each time. I also participated in many other Code Club activities.
