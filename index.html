<h2>About the website</h2>
This portfolio showcases not just the work I’ve done, but also the unique problems I’ve encountered and solved along the way. 
Each project documents the challenges that weren’t always addressed elsewhere and how I approached finding solutions. 
It’s a space where you can see the thought process behind tackling complex issues and how creative solutions were implemented to make a real impact. 
This collection reflects both the problems faced and the value created in overcoming them.

<h2>About Me</h2>

My name is Aarav Batra. I am the class of 2025 at East Brunswick High School. 
I have participated in many of my High School’s programs such as Varsity Football, Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA), Code Club, and Palette Club. 
I have also received an award and grant from the East Brunswick Education Foundation for creating a positive learning environment at East Brunswick. 
I like to program in my free time and I have many projects you can feel free to check out. 
My main interests are at the intersection of computer science, business, and exercise science/kinesiology.
